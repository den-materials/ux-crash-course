## Skeleton:

- Introduce the UX Pyramid of Needs
- Direct students in the art of ideation for their project
- Introduce what usability studies are, how users interact with them, and what they are meant to achieve
- Have students create rough, paper usability studies with each other
- [Bonus] Cross-UXD would be great here
